# SSCS Chipathon 2025 CreActive Team Repository

This repository is the CreActive team project for the SSCS Chipathon 2025 MOSbius track. We propose a topic on active filter building blocks which are configurable to construct variety of filter topologies.

## Project Overview

The initial idea of this project is to explore the possibility of translating filter transfer functions into an analog circuit through programming. Due to time constraints, we propose a simple prototype of this idea â€” namely, a MOSbius-style chip consisting of several op-amps, current mirrors, and arrays of passive component. Each of the op-amp terminals are connected to a switch matrix for internal routing and connection to analog GPIO. The filter charactheristic could be altered by programming the passive arrays or by adding external passive components. The frequency of operation is targeted to be around kilohertz range.

The circuit blocks in the design are listed below:
- 3x Single ended OTA
- 3x Differential output OTA
- 6x Array of 1k Ohm unit resistor
- 6x Array of 10k Ohm unit resistor
- 6x Array of 1 pF unit capacitor

The overall design is shown on the block diagram below:
